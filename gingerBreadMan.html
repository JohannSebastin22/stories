        <h1 class="gingerTitle">The Gingerbread Man</h1>
        <p class="gingerbreadmanStory"> Once upon a time, an old woman in the city lived with her husband in a very old house, both of them loved each other very much and used to distribute all their work together.
                                        One day an old woman made gingerbread in the shape of a man. When she cooked bread in the oven, the gingerbread in the shape of a man jumped out of the tray and ran towards the window.
        <p class="gingerbreadmanStory"> He jumped out of the window and shouted,” I am a gingerbread man, Do not eat me.”
                                        The old couple tried to chase him but he ran so fast that they could not catch him.
                                        A pig saw him running. The pig said,” Stop, I would like to eat you gingerbread.” The bread man ran faster and said to the pig,” I am gingerbread man, you can not catch me.”           
        <p class="gingerbreadmanStory"> A crow saw him. The crow said,” Stop, I would like to eat your bread.” The bread man ran faster and said to the crow,” I am gingerbread man, you can not catch me.”
                                        Then a horse ran behind him to catch him. Now they all were chasing the gingerbread man.
                                        He came near the side of a river. He feared that if he entered the water, he would become soggy.
                                        A clever fox pretended to be nice and showed him that he wanted to help him in crossing the river.
                                        The ginger man bread believed him. As soon as he reached near to the fox, he tossed him up and ate him.
